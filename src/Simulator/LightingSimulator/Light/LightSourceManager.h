 * LightSourceManager.h
 *
 *  Created on: Jan 28, 2011
 *      Author: tychi
 *
 * Maintainer of all LightSource instances. Manages
 * 	- the uniform buffers for the lightsource data (matrices, colors, positions, directions etc..)
 *  - the shadowmap texture (2D/Cube/Array)
 *  - relevant other data to be passed as uniforms to shaders
 *
 *  This class has the "ultimate" authority to dominate shader settings;
 *  Example: if the LightSourceManager is configured only for one pointlight,
 *  a shader must override contradicting shaderfeatures;  Only this way a constistent
 *  rendering can be achieved;
