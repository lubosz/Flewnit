 *
 * Mechanical Simulations on particle-based objects are performed here
 * with OpenCL;
 *
 * The CL PRograms have been optimized to my best knowlegde,
 * except in matters of memory footprint and bandwidth;
 * To optimized those two domains, values with no direct semantic reference have to get packed
 * together, alignment and numerical stability has to give way to tight packing;
 * This stuff causes headaches, and hence has not been performed so far, as there shall be no elevated
 * risk of blowing the sim for numerical reasons while still developing;
 *
 * Theoretical presumption:
 * At least on non-high end devices, the performance of this simulation is bandwidth-limited;
 * Solely the acquisition of neighbor particles without any management overhead costs
 * around
 * (27 grid cells * 32 particles per cell  *12 floats per particle *4 Bytes per float *
 *   (2^18/8)non-empty Grid cells ) = 1.36 Gigabyte per single SPH step;
 *
 * Including the rest of the attribute transfers, the maintainance overhead (uniform grid lookup etc),
 * the many radix sort passes and phases (usually 9), the many scattered reads during the reorder phase,
 * and finally the grpahical rendering, we may come close or even exceed the 2 GB/frame bandwidth usage;
 *
 * Given that this thesis is coded on a notebook with a Geforce GT 435m GPU having 25.6 GB/s
 * memory bandwith, there will be no framerate higher than 25.6/2 = 128 fps solely for bandwith reasons;
 * After eastern, I'm gonna buy a GTX570 with 6 times the bandwidth (152 GB/s), I'm curious about its
 * performance;
