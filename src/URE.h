 *	\brief The heart of Flewnit: The Rending Engine trying a "unified approach";
 *
 *	\details
 *	The class with the overblown name "URE", short for "Unified Rendering Engine"; Why unified? Because the long term goal of this Engine is to overcome
 *	the asymmetric treatment of "Rendering" and "Physics Simulation"; We should either talk about Image rendering and mechanical rendering or about lighting simulation
 *	and mechanical simulation; Hence, it is tried to keep the data structures as symmetric as possible,Geometry, Material, and so on;
 *	In the far future, one could try to realize and conntect differen Physics Simulation techniques, like Soft Bodies, Cloth, Hair etc. The rendering pipleline shoul allow this.
 *
 *
 *	Furthermore, it is tried to treat the "buffer concept" as generic as possible, i.e. tu nuify arrays,textures, vertex buffers, OpenCL buffers etc.
 *
 *	It is also tried to keep the Rendering pipeline as flexible as possible, so that one can write Pipeline-Stage-Plugins (at the moment just realised as Classes, atual Plugin stuff
 *	won't be implemented in the first place), which validate themselves against the rest of the Pipeline, so that various simulations can be established;
 *
