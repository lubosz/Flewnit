	 *  input: Geometry, should be a triangle mesh with position vertices and
	 *  	   index buffer;
	 *
	 *  output: ParticleizedRigidBody containing a buffer containing
	 *  		mNumMaxParticlesPerRigidBody Vector4D's,
	 *  		where the first numParticles vectors represent positions of the non-empty
	 *  		voxels, and the rest of the vectors is ware zero;
	 *
	 *	Note:
	 *		- parameters like represented volumes of a RB particle are
	 *		  global params, because we wanna omit both oversampling and sponges;
	 *		- no scaling suported to stay as simple as possible;
	 *		  scale geometry position values directly (and compensate by scene node scale)
	 *		  before calling this routine if you need to deviate from the default mesh scale;
	 *
	 *	Tip:
	 *		  In a "physically based unified rendering engine", decoupling a scale from actual
	 *		  physical properties causes headaches;
	 *  	  Omit any scaling via transforms everywhere if possible, above all after initializing
	 *  	  the mechanical components; Apply all transform scales to the position buffers
	 *		  (as this framework allows only consistent scale over all dimensions, the normals
	 *		  won't be harmed); Of course you have to make sure that objects with different scales
	 *		  do not use the same buffer, and that a scale is applied only once per shared buffer;
	 *
	 *	NOTE: not implemented yet (april 21, 2011) TODO
