The Generic Buffer is needed as a storage for a Uniform Grid acceleration structure
storing
	0.: The Amount of the containing particles
	1.: index to the first of the containing Particles
	2.: The Amount of the containing static triangles
	3.: index to the first of the containing static Triangles

It COULD be realized a a 3D Integer Texture, bu I don't like this concept (yet).

Drawing this Geometry type has only sense for debug purposes
