Algorithm for LightingSimulator initialization;

global init pass:
- 	LightingSimulator gets Buffers from MechanicSimulator as input and creates an empty LightSim-global render target dependent on the gloabel default rendering mode 
	(nondefered, deferred, layered depth images GI)

pipeline init pass:
[preconditions: Scene has been loaded Worldobjects with their corresponding Geometry- and Material-Objects have been created, but material Shaders hav not been creatred yet;]
	for each pipeline stage:
	-	Build LightSimPipeline with LightSimPipeLineFactory; Every Stage checks the global RenderTarget if it meets the its requirements.
		(buffer allocation for needed semantics, channel datatypes and layout, ping pong buffer feature etc.). 
		If it doesn't meet the requirements, allocate missing buffers, enhance
